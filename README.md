# [TGCE] Restyler for DnD5e 3+

This module allows for restyling of some of the DnD5e System components for Foundry VTT. 
Creating this module would not have been possible without the wonderful people who haunt the various channels of the Official Foundry VTT Discord Server.

## The Restyler UI is accessed from the Character Sheet using the header button labeled with a paintbrush.

### Restyler config is per Actor. If you want to copy the Restyler config from one actor to another, you can use the *Copy Flags from Actor* macro in the module's Restyler Macros compendium. 

- This macro will eventually make its way into core functionality of the mod.

## Player Character Sheet Functional Enhancements

- A button is added to the skill tree to toggle between skill and tools, reducing overall shett height. Especially on higher level characters with many tool proficiencies.

## Chatcard Pill color highlights.

- The chat pills for profieicy and equipped status will be color coded. These are currently color coded green/maroon, but in a future release will be selectable to account for color blindness.
- Concentration pill is colored yellow with black text to be more visible. 

## Provided sheet banners

- The following four images, sized at 800x170 pixels, can be found in the modules/tgce-restyler-5e3/assets folder. You will have to manually navigate to the location using the file picker. This location will be set as default in a future release.

### Additional Examples
- The picture below uses only the Hue Rotation option to adjust the coloring of the header on an otherwise stock DnD5e character sheet.
